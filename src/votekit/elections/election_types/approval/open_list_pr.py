    Open-list party-list proportional representation (PR) election method.

    In Open-list, each party gives a list of candidates to elect. Voters can cast votes for individual candidates
    as well as whole parties (as opposed to closed-list PR where voters can only vote for parties). The total number
    of seats allocated to each party is determined by a function that takes in the sum of votes recieved by
    each party and their individual candidates as well as the current party seat share. Once a party's seats are determined, the candidates are elected from the party's
    list in order of their individual vote totals.
