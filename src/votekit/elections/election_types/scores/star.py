class Star(Election):
    """
    STAR (Score Then Automatic Runoff) voting method. Voters score each candidate with
    any numerical value up to L, where L is a user-specified maximum score,
    using votekit.Ballot objects with score dictionaries. Scores may be positive,
    and missing scores are treated as 0. The two candidates with the highest total scores
    advance to an automatic runoff, where the candidate preferred by more voters (based on
    higher scores) wins. Ties in the runoff are resolved using the specified tiebreaker.

    Args:
        profile (PreferenceProfile): Profile from votekit, containing a list of Ballot objects
            with score dictionaries mapping candidates to scores and optional weights.
        L (float, optional): Maximum score per candidate. Defaults to 5.
        tiebreak (str, optional): Tiebreak method to use. Options are None or 'most_top_ratings'.
            If 'most_top_ratings', the finalist with more ballots assigning the maximum score wins.
            If None, a tie results in no winner (None). Defaults to None.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If L is not positive or there are fewer than two candidates.
        TypeError: If ballots lack score dictionaries or have non-positive weights.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing:
            winner (str or None): The winning candidate, or None if a tie occurs and tiebreak is None.
            finalists (tuple): The two candidates in the runoff.
            scores (dict): Total scores per candidate.
            runoff (dict): Runoff vote counts for finalists and "No Preference".
