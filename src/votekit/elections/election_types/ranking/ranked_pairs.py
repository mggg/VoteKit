    See `Ranked Pairs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs>`_ for more details.
    Any ambiguity is resolved lexicographically, so that the candidate with the
    first name alphabetically is preferred in the case of a tie.

    The idea of the Ranked Pairs election is to take the head-to-head results of the candidates
    and then sort them by the margin of victory. We then lock this order in and construct
    a directed graph from the head-to-head results by traversing the locked order and skipping
    any edges that would create a cycle in the directed graph. The final ranking of the election
    is then determined by the dominating tiers of the directed graph with ties broken
    lexicographically.

        profile (PreferenceProfile): Profile to conduct election on.
        m (int, optional): Number of seats to elect. Defaults to 1.
