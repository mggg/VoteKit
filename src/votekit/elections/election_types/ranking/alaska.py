class Alaska(RankingElection):
    """
    Alaska election. Election method that first runs a Plurality election to choose a user-specified
    number of final-round candidates, then runs STV to choose :math:`m` winners.

    Args:
        profile (PreferenceProfile): Profile to conduct election on.
        m_1 (int, optional): Number of final round candidates, i.e. number of winners of Plurality
            round. Defaults to 2.
        m_2 (int, optional): Number of seats to elect in STV round, i.e. number of overall winners.
            Defaults to 1.
        transfer (Callable[[str, Union[Fraction, float], Union[tuple[Ballot], list[Ballot]], int], tuple[Ballot,...]], optional):
            Transfer method. Defaults to fractional transfer.
            Function signature is elected candidate, their number of first-place votes, the list of
            ballots with them ranked first, and the threshold value. Returns the list of ballots
            after transfer.
        quota (str, optional): Formula to calculate quota. Accepts "droop" or "hare".
            Defaults to "droop".
        simultaneous (bool, optional): True if all candidates who cross threshold in a round are
            elected simultaneously, False if only the candidate with highest first-place votes
            who crosses the threshold is elected in a round. Defaults to True.
        tiebreak (str, optional): Tiebreak method to use. Options are None, 'random', and 'borda'.
            Defaults to None, in which case a tie raises a ValueError.
