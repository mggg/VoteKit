class RankingElection(Election):
    """
    Abstract class for ranking election types. Validates that profile contains ranked ballots.

    Args:
        profile (PreferenceProfile): The initial profile of ballots.
        score_function (Callable[[PreferenceProfile], dict[str, float]], optional):
            A function that converts profiles to a score dictionary mapping candidates to
            their current score. Used in creating ElectionState objects and sorting candidates in
            Round 0. If None, no score dictionary is saved and all candidates are tied in Round 0.
            Defaults to None.
        sort_high_low (bool, optional): How to sort candidates based on `score_function`. True sorts
            from high to low. Defaults to True.

    Attributes:
        election_states (list[ElectionState]): a list of election states, one for each round of
            the election. The list is 0 indexed, so the initial state is stored at index 0, round 1
            at 1, etc.
        score_function (Callable[[PreferenceProfile], dict[str, float]], optional):
            A function that converts profiles to a score dictionary mapping candidates to
            their current score. Used in creating ElectionState objects. Defaults to None.
        length (int): the number of rounds of the election.
