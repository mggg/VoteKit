    A "dominating set" is any set S of candidates such that everyone in S beats everyone outside of
    S head-to-head. The top tier (which is well defined) is often called the "Smith set," and if it
    is just one person, they are called the "Condorcet candidate." The Smith method of election
    declares the Smith set to be the winners, which means that users do not get to specify the
    number of winners.
