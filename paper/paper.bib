 abstract = {We consider the problem of forming a testbed of elections to be used for numerical experiments (such as testing algorithms or estimating the frequency of a given phenomenon). We seek elections that come from well-known statistical distributions and are as diverse as possible. To this end, we define a (pseudo)metric over elections, generate a set of election instances, and measure distances between them, to assess how diverse they are. Finally, we show how to use these elections to test election-related algorithms.},
