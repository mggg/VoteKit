    "# Getting started with VoteKit\n",
    "\n",
    "VoteKit is a Python package developed by MGGG in order to support computational social choice researchers as well as practitioners and advocates interested in so-called \"alternative\" systems of election. This first section will help us hit the ground running by introducing some of our key vocabulary and introducing some Python syntax along the way. By the end of the section, you should know about ballots, preference profiles, preference intervals, blocs/slates, and election systems.\n",

    "### Ranked Ballots\n",
    "\n",
    "The first order of business is ballots. In the context of ranked choice voting, a ballot records a voter's preferences as a linear ordering of the candidates. If a voter casts the ballot $A>B>C$, this means they prefer candidate $A$ to $B$ and candidate $B$ to $C$. (We often use the $>$ symbol to indicate higher preference.) Let's see how ballots are stored in VoteKit. First we import the necessary modules."

    "There are a few ways to input ballots into VoteKit. You can type them all by hand as we did above, you can read them in from real-world vote records, or you can generate them within VoteKit. While we will dive a lot deeper into reading and generating in future sections, it is worthwhile to introduce some of the vocabulary surrounding generative models here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of our generative models rely on a **preference interval**. A preference interval stores information about the relative strengths of a voter's priorities for candidates. We visualize this, unsurprisingly, as an interval. We take the interval $[0,1]$ and divide it into pieces, where we've taken all the preference weights and scaled so they add to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\"A\": 0.7, \"B\": 0.2, \"C\": 0.1}\n",
    "```\n",
    "is a dictionary that represents an ordered preference interval where A is preferred to B by a ratio of 7:2, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Later, the ballot generator models will pull from these preferences to create a ballot for each voter.\n",

    "While both say there is no preference for candidate C, if the latter interval is fed into VoteKit, that third candidate will never appear on a generated ballot. If we feed it the former interval, the third candidate will appear at the bottom of the ballot.\n",
